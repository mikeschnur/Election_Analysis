## Election-Audit Summary

It is evident that this is script is effective in tallying not only the total votes within an election but also the total votes within each county. With simple modifications and the addition of a loop this script could also reveal what percentage of voters in each county are voting for which candidate. Which could prove to be valueable information for the formatting of future elections. With a more in-depth voter data file this script could be modified to show how certain groups chose to vote, for example, the script could reveal the percentage of males who voted for a certain candidate compared to women.
